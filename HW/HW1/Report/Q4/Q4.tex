\section{Question 4}
\subsection{a}
Let $A$ and $B$ be diagonal matrices of order $n$. A diagonal matrix is a matrix in which all off-diagonal elements are zero. Therefore, $A$ and $B$ can be represented as:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
a_1 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 \\
0 & a_2 & 0 & \ldots & 0 \\
0 & 0 & a_3 & \ldots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & a_n
\end{bmatrix}
\]

\[
B = \begin{bmatrix}
b_1 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 \\
0 & b_2 & 0 & \ldots & 0 \\
0 & 0 & b_3 & \ldots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & b_n
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Now, let's compute the product $AB$:

\[
AB = \begin{bmatrix}
a_1 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 \\
0 & a_2 & 0 & \ldots & 0 \\
0 & 0 & a_3 & \ldots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & a_n
\end{bmatrix} \cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
b_1 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 \\
0 & b_2 & 0 & \ldots & 0 \\
0 & 0 & b_3 & \ldots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & b_n
\end{bmatrix}
\]

When you multiply two matrices, the $(i, j)$-th element of the product is given by the dot product of the $i$-th row of the first matrix and the $j$-th column of the second matrix. In this case, since $A$ and $B$ are diagonal matrices, the only non-zero elements of the product $AB$ will be on the diagonal, and they will be the product of the corresponding elements of $A$ and $B$.

So, for the product $AB$, the $(i, i)$-th element will be $a_i \cdot b_i$ and all other elements will be zero. Therefore, $AB$ is also a diagonal matrix, and the $(i, j)$-th element is zero for $i \neq j$.
\subsection{b}
To prove that $BA = AB$, we can use the commutative property of multiplication for diagonal matrices. Since $A$ and $B$ are both diagonal matrices, the order in which they are multiplied does not affect the result. Therefore, $BA = AB$.

This can be stated formally as:

\[
AB = BA
\]

So, the product of two diagonal matrices is commutative.
